# Detector file, channel list, and cross-sections from SNOwGLoBES

Contains detection and interaction information to compute expected interaction rates using SNEWPY:

* detector_configurations.dat : detector masses (total mass, and mass of reference target)
* xscns: interaction cross-section (the files contain two columns: log_10(E/1GeV) and sigma(E)/(E [GeV]))
* channels: information about interaction channels for each detection material (flavor, parity, weighting factor compared to reference target)
